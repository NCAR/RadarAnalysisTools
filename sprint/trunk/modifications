990112: List of changes made that led to this release

  1. Create a TIME field within DORADE path.

  2. Combine MAXEL and NID into single parameter statement

      PARAMETER (MAXEL=150,NID=129+3*MAXEL)

     to make it easier to increase the maximum number of scans.
     This is needed mainly for DORADE sweep files.

  3. Cleanup return from DORVOL when reading sweep files since
     the return doesn't happen until something other than INPUT
     has been read.  But, this might be QUIT making the program
     go on when it shouldn't.  I added a line "END     RUNOVER"
     in the input stream which works fine.

  4. It isn't clear if transfer of fields from cfldnam -> fldnam
     should be done with strncpy or strcpy.  I used strcpy.  The
     problem with the field names was indirectly being caused by
     
      CHARACTER*7 RADNAM,FLTNUM,FLDNAM(MAXFLD)

     in DORVOL, where RADNAM,FLTNUM,FLDNAM are CHARACTER*8 elsewhere.
     I changed to same dimensions.

  5. Can we really increase the number of fields MAXFLD to 16 since
     this implies more than MAXFLD=8 (see METHOD.f) in old version?
     If this is true, we can generate many more output fields.  Keep
     in mind that UNFOLD of velocity automatically produces QUAL field.
     See METHOD.f routine.  TIME field should not be looked for in the
     input, but rather automatically generated.

  6. This is also true of increasing MAXEL from 80 to 150, and MAXRNG
     from 1024 to 1200.  Need to check if something somewhere hasn't
     been accounted for.

  7. Test in CRTOUT.f prevents any interpolations within 0.1 km of radar

C  360 SCANS ONLY
      IF(ABS(XT).LT.0.1.AND.ABS(YT).LT.0.1) GO TO 15

  8. In SINSRT.f, DIMENSION A(1) apparently causes subscript error if
     you use -C (subscript checks) option in compiling, but debug prints
     so no problem.  DIMENSION A(JJ) eliminates subscript error.
     
  9. In RDRYDK.f, subscript error for KPKBUF. See also WRRYDK.f
     but doesn't work correctly unless KPKBUF dimensioned ILSTREC?
     Has something to do with the implied DOs for WRITE/READ scratch unit 1.

 10. Looks like COMMON block in RDRYDK may not have been spelled correctly
     since RDRY only in RDRYDK and WRRY only in WRRYDK.  This meant that
     ILSTREC was not passed correctly into RDRYDK until after first disk
     read.  Eliminated RDRY in RDRYDK 

c-----COMMON /RDRY/ILSTREC
      COMMON /WRRY/ILSTREC,IWRYBEG

     First DO I=1,IBEGREC-1 was screwed up since KPKBUF was dimensioned
     ILSTREC=0 for first read, IBEG=1.

 11. In TRPARVOL, TRPPPI, and TRPVOL pass dimension of ICART in call to
     RSCART.

 12. MAXFLD ripples through all TRP*, IPKDAT, IGTDAT, and COMBIN routines.

 13. Bumped up dimension of ICOB in COMMON block from 

      COMMON ICART(MAXPLN),ICOB(IDIM,2,MAXYZ),IBLV(IDIM,NRCBF,8),
     X     ZRTAB(MXCRT,2)

     to

      COMMON ICART(MAXPLN),ICOB(IDIM,4,MAXYZ),IBLV(IDIM,NRCBF,8),
     X     ZRTAB(MXCRT,2)

     Also in OUTPCK, but IVOL is actually ICOB in CALL OUTPCK.

      DIMENSION LHED(10),IVOL(IDIM,4,NX,NY,NZ),IAXK(ITER),CSP(3,3),
     X     ITAPHD(510),RBUF(MAXPLN),SCLFLD(MAXFLD)

     Affects routines UFCART and OUTPCK.  Last subscript problem 
     was occuring in OUTPCK loops 

         DO 540 L=1,NFLDS
            SCALE=SCLFLD(L)
            ITIT(1)=NAMFLD(L)
            INDX=0
            IFWP = ((L-1)/4) + 1
            LPOS = L - ((IFWP-1) * 4)
            MSHIF = 64 - (16*LPOS)
            DO 530 J=1,NY
               DO 520 I=1,NX
                  INDX=INDX+1
                  CALL GBYTES(IVOL(1,IFWP,I,J,K),IAXK(INDX),
     X                 48-MSHIF,16,0,1)
               .........

     since IFWP for NFLDS > 8 (old MAXFLDS limit) exceeds 2, the second
     dimension in ICOB.  This was causing runover into adjacent array and
     picking up 0.0 values.
     

 14. Pass IROV into INPFIL from DORVOL, NEXVOL, RPNCAR,UFCART, and UFNCAR
     to stop INPUT summary printout.  Added UNIT number to DORSWP input
     lines and eliminated VOLUME FOUND line in DORVOL if in RUNOVER mode.

     Minor error in NEXVOL with setting ICOMBN, tested IROV=2 but doesn't
     exist(?)

 15. It is not clear if COMMON /CFLD/NFLDS is supposed to be the number of
     input or output fields.  Track this down.  Works only if NFLDS is the
     number of input fields.  Minor change in MTHSUM to print output field 
     number (I) with I2, not I1 in Format #125.

 16. Normal processing of several DORADE volume scans with appending to the
     output now works.  Was passing wrong value for NUFST (3, should be 0)
     back to UFCART.  In DORVOL after AIRCHK and SETVOL.

 17. Appending to output doesn't work when in RUNOVER mode.

 18. In NEXSWP, the first sweep (ISWP=0) returns NRAYS=2 for first beam read
     so min Elevation for GRIDPPI was always = 0.0 in ID(129), not 0.48 as it
     should have been.  Don't know why C routine does this, but fixed fortran.
     This needs to be done in NEXSWP, not NEXVOL, to get the azimuth info such
     as BEG-END azimuth and spacing correct or pass these into NEXSWP.

 19. I added a lot of documentation comments into routines to help keep track
     of program flow, variables, and what some important routines do and where
     they're called from.

*20. Bumped up MXGAT and MXFLD in nexrad.h to be consistent with rest of code.
     Fixed apparent compression of SW field when doing both VE and SW.

 21. Worked over makefile, makefiles.list, and includes.list so that when *.h
     or SPRINT.INC are changed the affected modules will be recompiled.

*22. Passed scaling factor (SF) from HEDSET back into CARTAP-->OUTPCK-->BLHED
     so that coordinate in current level header is scaled.  CEDRIC expects it
     to be scaled by SF = ID(68).  SF < 100 is needed when grids  .ge. 327.67
     
     Changed my mind.  To be consistent with the way Sprint handles z1,z2,zd
     the level header coordinate which is always z is multiplied by 1000.
     Then in the FETCHZ module of Cedric, change VALLEV to stuff/1000.
     Since Cedric assumes the Z's are in meters in the file.

 23. Added Nyquist velocity to NEXRAD level header (#10) since it isn't the           
     same for all elevation levels. 
 
     From COMMON /CRNG/ in UFCART --> CARTAP --> OUTPCK --> BLHED 

*24. Passed appropiate Nyquist velocity into TRPD for unfolding.  See TRPVOL,
     TRPARVOL, and TRPPPI.  When doing GRIDPPI, NEXRAD Nyquist changes.

     This causes beams in 9.89 deg and above to be thrown out since the 
     velocities are outside the first level Nyquist=26.42 m/s, not the current
     level Nyquist=30.78 m/s. Error in old Sprint:
     
      +++  INPUT VELOCITY VALUES OUTSIDE THE NYQUIST RANGE-  +++
      +++   UNFOLDING CANNOT BE PERFORMED                    +++

25. Made variables in common blocks /ADJUST/, /FNAMES/, and /SCNDAT/ have
    variable dimensions (MAXFLD) since they store information on fields.

26. Fixed USRORIGIN routine to re-order inputs, with radar first and origin
    second.  Changed to input of ANGXAX rather than altitude of origin since
    ANGXAX may not be set whene USRORIGIN is called.  This was causing x and 
    y of the radar to be interchanged since ANGXAX=0 always.  The calls to
    ll2xy conversions needed to have their input longitudes be -(long) since
    the convention for these transformers is west longitude is positive and
    the NEXRAD network has west as negative.  Also, changed the logic to be
    more straightforward, with radar lat-lon as first priority.  If origin
    is not specified then the origin is set to the radar.

27. Consolidated PARAMETERS and put in SPRINT.INC, with INCLUDE 'SPRINT.INC'
    where needed.  Replaced NPREC with MAXPLN where needed since they are the
    same variable.  Likewise for NRCBF2 and NRCBF.

28. The INTERP command for pseudo-closest point allows DZ and VE to be moved
    different amounts (gate spacing is default) for NEXRAD since DZ and VE
    have 1 km and 250m spacings.  REMAP in CEDRIC has provision only for
    one distance-to-move parameter.

990219: List of fixes made that led to this release

    See differences.990112-990219 for differences between the 990112 and 990219
    releases.

 1. Incorporated IBAD into SPRINT.INC, leading to small changes in several
    routines.  Incluced JRH6 (64), JRH7 (100), and JRH8 (1000) scaling factors.

 2. Change assembling of "VOL. NAME" to month-day-hour-min of volume start
    time.  Eliminated fixed axis part to allow two-digit months.

 3. Cleaned up INPFIL.f to make it easier to add radars and experiments.  Fixed
    defaults so that CCOPE and CP-2 are used.  The name of a radar is no longer
    a requirement.  When INPFIL is executed, it assumes CCOPE and CP-2 until
    they are reset by ORIGIN command (if it is included).

 4. Fixed minor problem with LL2XY conversion where the wrong sign was used
    when the latitude was nearly equal to the origin.  Azimuth angles west of
    the origin near 270 deg were actually being assigned to 90 deg.
 
 5. The rounding done in CRTSET was fixed to make MIN-MAX-Number of grid points
    consistent rather than requiring that the user input values that would give
    an integer number of grid points from (MAX-MIN)/DEL.

 6. Decided to retain stripped down version of LAT_LON, rather than allowing
    the origin to be setable as done in CEDRIC and PPI_MMM.

 7. Fixed problem with using FXTABLE for Universal format (GENAZM is called).
    This involved restoring RDRY common block in RDRYDK.f

 8. Range averaging code is no longer passed through when the number of gates
    to average is one.  See TRPD.f

 9. Fixed USORIGIN to be able to distinguish between leaving ANGXAX blank and
    having it be a true 0.

10. Added GBYTES/SBYTES routines in subdirectory in case SCD libraries are not
    present.  SPRINT only requires these, not entire NCAR Graphics where they
    are usually installed.

990921: List of fixes made, but not yet released

 1. Bandaid in BEAMIN to stop reading beyond fort.1 end-of-data.

 2. Added DUMP routine to allow for turning on dumping of beam housekeeping.
    Implemented for NEXRAD (NEXSWP and NEXVOL) and UF.

 3. Checked a patch in RAYIN to allow for two EOF's in a row when trying to 
    append.  This was problem with UF from Stacy Brodzik which has since been
    fixed in the xltrs where the double eof was added incorrectly (zero length
    Fortran-blocked records ==> EOF).

 4. Cleanup in RDRYDK and WRRYDK which are two routines that write and read the
    SPRINT internal disk file (fort.1).  I still don't fully understand these
    two routines.  They should be rewritten sometime because it looks like
    they'll always have to be fixed and refixed.

 5. Turning on/off debugging statements in SETVOL and TRPPPI to try to
    understand how SPRINT really works.  Very painful.

 6. Added UFDUMP for beam dumping of universal format data (mods in UFCART and
    UFNCAR).  Passing IFD and IFD_RAYS around from DUMP module.

2001.0521 - Increased the number of levels that can be processed from MAXZ=15
 to MAXZ=35.  This was tested in both Sprint and Cedric and all seems okay.

2001.0531 - DEC/Alpha doesn't like a MOD(MRAYS,IFD_RAYS) calculation when the
 the second argument is identically zero.  Changed all IF(IFD.EQ.1... tests
 in UFNCAR, RPNCAR, and DORSWP to have the IFD test separate from the MOD test.
 This way when DUMP is turned off, IFD_RAYS=0 in the MOD test will never be
 executed since the IF(IFD.EQ.1) test will fail with IFD=0.        

2001.1108 - TIME field is incorrect when a 00Z crossing occurs within a volume
 scan.  Added first-day variable (JDAY) from first beam read within a volume
 for comparison with the current-beam variable (IDAY).  If there is a change,
 the current hour is increased by 24.  This affected the following routines:
 UFNCAR, RPNCAR, DORVOL-SWP, and NEXVOL-SWP.
