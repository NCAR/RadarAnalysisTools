	Building SPRINT executable from source code tar file

1 ) Get the source code tar file from the EOL anonymous ftp server
    using a web browser:

    a. ftp://ftp.eol.ucar.edu/pub/temp/users/ljmill
    b. Click on Sprint and download files

	sprint_99feb_doc_doc.pdf
        sprint.inp
	sprint_2010-1124.tar
    
2)  Create a directory (RadAnl_Tools) for the Radar data analysis
    tools:
	mkdir ./RadAnl_Tools

3) Untar the Sprint tar file containing the source code into the above
   source directory.  The tar file includes all subversion-related 
   files and 32- or 64-bit executables (sprint_32.e and sprint_64.e) 
   built under (cat /etc/redhat-release):

   a. 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.8 (Tikanga) 
   b. 64-bit CentOS release 5.8 (Final) 


   and compiler gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-52) 

	gfortran -v
   
	cd ./RadAnl_Tools
	tar xvf sprint_CCYY-MMDD.tar

   a. The last two commands will produce ./RadAnl_Tools/sprint
   b. cd ./RadAnl_Tools/sprint/trunk
   c. You can test sprint_32.e or sprint_64.e to see if the included
      build will run on your machine.  If it does start, you should
      see information on RELEASE DATE, computer word size, and
      other SPRINT.INC parameters.  The included executables were
      built for 32- and 64-bit little Endian machines [WORDSZ parameter
      and BYTE_ORDER 1 (cedric.h)].

4) Execute set.links-32 (set.links-64) to link for 32-bit (64-bit) builds.
   You should now have makefile, op_sys.h, cedric.h, dorade.h, and 
   SPRINT.INC linked to the appropriate WORDSZ (32 or 64) files. 

5) Create the executable by typing

	   make >& make.out & 

.  This puts make in the background and redirects stdout (output from 
   make) and stderr (system errors) into the file make.out which will 
   then allow you to send us any errors that you may encounter during 
   the build process.  There will likely be some warnings during 
   compilation, but these don't affect the way the program executes.  
   By capturing the output during the make process, we might be able 
   to help you resolve any errors that have occurred.

	   make >& make.out & 

   Check the makefile for the name of the output executable that you 
   have built, either sprint_32.e or sprint_64.e, depending on which
   set.links that was used.
