# This makefile was produced by /usr/bin//fmgen
# If it is envoked by the command line
#	make 
# it will compile the fortran modules indicated by SRCS into the object
# modules indicated by OBJS and then use LDR to produce an executable
# named a.out.
#
# To make a profiled version of a.out (named a.out.prof) on a CRAY 2
# Computer System use the command line
#	make  a.out.prof
# WARNING:  DO NOT PROFILE AND FLOWTRACE AT THE SAME TIME
#
# To remove all the object and listing files but leave the executable
# use the command line
#	make  clean
#
# To remove everything but the source files use the command line
#	make  clobber
#
# To remove the source files created by /usr/bin//fmgen and this makefile
# use the command line
#	make  void
#
# The parameters SRCS and OBJS should not need to be changed.  If, however,
# you need to add a new module add the name of the source module to the
# SRCS parameter and add the name of the resulting object file to the OBJS
# parameter.  The new modules are not limited to fortran, but may be C, YACC,
# LEX, or CAL.  An explicit rule will need to be added for PASCAL modules.
#
# (LJM - 09/01/09):
#    Tested adding gbytes.f, sbytes.f, i1mach.f from NCARG source
#    No longer need -lncarg -lncarg_gks -lncarg_c -lX11 -lm
#    But still need -lncarg_c for ishift.c module since I can't find it
#    Until ishift is resolved and -lncarg_c (common source) is no longer
#    needed this is no point in compiling and loading gbytes, sbytes, and
#    ilmach.  Leave this off the makefiles.list for the time being.. 
#
# (LJM - 08/03/10):
#    Tested adding gbytes.f, sbytes.f, i1mach.f, ishift.c from NCAR/NCL
#    source code.  No longer need -L/opt/local/ncl_ncarg/lib
#
