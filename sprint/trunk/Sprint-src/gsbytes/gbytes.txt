GBYTES

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
GBYTES code is used by many DSS programs to handle binary packing. There are
versions available for most popular computer systems as well as FORTRAN and
C versions which have application on many computer systems. Complete
documentation for the GBYTES library contains more detailed information on
the various versions of GBYTES.

The GBYTES Library

Below are the various versions of GBYTES. If the program has a version
number, it is recommended to get version 1. Simply select the correct
program for your computer and compile.

   * c.c: C Version
   * c32.c: C Version, set up for 32 bit word size, and SUN f77 FORTRAN to C
     linkage.
   * c64c.c: C Version, set up for 64 bit word size, and Cray cft77 FORTRAN
     to C linkage.
   * cdc.v1: Control Data - Version 1
   * cdc.v2: Control Data - Version 2
   * cdc.v3: Control Data - Version 3 (Cyber205)
   * cft77.f: FORTRAN for Cray running UNICOS (from f77.f)
   * cray.v1: Cray - Version 1
   * cray.v2: Cray - Version 2
   * cray.v3: Cray - Version 3
   * dec.v1: DEC/VMS - Version 1
   * f77.f: Unix FORTRAN Recommended for most Unix-like machines
   * f77hp.f: Minor mod to f77.f for HP execution
   * fortran.for: Generic FORTRAN with INITAL
   * ibm.mac: IBM macros which may be needed on some systems
   * ibm.v1: IBM version
   * msgbytei.for: Microsoft FORTRAN for PCs
   * msgbytes.c: Microsoft c for PCs
   * msgbytes.for: General PC FORTRAN
   * ncarg.c: Slightly faster C Version but only for 32-bit machines
   * rs6000.f: IBM RS6000 with INITAL
   * uni.v1: UNIVAC - Version 1
   * uni.v2: UNIVAC - Version 2
   * unix.f: Unix FORTRAN with INITAL

Compiling Notes

PCs
     The msgbytei.for and msgbytes.c files are PC versions of GBYTES for
     Microsoft FORTRAN and C users. msgbytes.c is a minor variation of c.c
     and msgbytei.for is an interface routine which allows FORTRAN programs
     to call C subroutines. The FORTRAN package also contains the SWAP4
     routine which can be used the handle the byte swapping problem on PCs.
     msgbytes.for is a stand-alone FORTRAN version of GBYTES and SBYTES for
     use with Microsoft FORTRAN. It could probably be adapted for other PC
     compilers.
DEC
     dec.v1 contains FORTRAN subroutines and macros apropos VMS operating
     systems. ULTRIX and Alpha O.S. can use one of the Unix versions in
     conjunction with swap.for. The swap.for program contains byte swapping
     subroutines for 4 and 2 byte swapping. These are primarily useful on
     DEC machines for handling the byte swapping problem.
UNIX:
     c.c is the generic C version and f77.f is the generic FORTRAN version.
     unix.f can also be used but note that it requires a call to INITAL to
     initialize the routines. rs6000.f is a slightly modified version of
     "unix.f" which should work on IBM RS6000 stations. f77.f has been
     tested on a Sun, IBM RS6000, and DEC Alpha. ncarg.c is slightly faster
     than c.c but only runs on 32-bit architectures.
