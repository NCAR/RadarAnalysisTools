	Building SPRINT executable from source code tar file

1 ) Get the source code tar file from the MMM ftp server.  Contact L. Jay
    Miller for the procedure since this is not an anonymous server.
    
2)  Create a directory for the source code and one where the executable
    is to be built.

	    mkdir Sprint/src
	    mkdir Sprint/build

3) Untar the SPRINT tar file containing the source code into the above
   source directory.

	   cd Sprint/src
	   tar xvf ../sprint.YYMMDD.tar

4) Go to the build directory and set soft links to platform independent
   files.

	   cd ../build
	   ln -s ../src/* .

5) Set soft links to platform dependent files.  Platform dependent
   subdirectories exist for DEC/Alpha (alpha), CRAYs (cray), 
   DEC/Ultrix (dec), HPs (hp), IBM (ibm), Linux (linux), SGI (sgi), 
   and SUN/solaris (sun).  In this example, links are set for DEC
   Ultrix.
   
	   ln -s ../src/dec/makefile .
	   ln -s ../src/dec/cedric.h .

6) Create the executable by typing.  This puts make in the background
   and redirects stdout (output from make) and stderr (system errors)
   into the file make.out which will then allow you to send us any
   errors that you may encounter during the build process.  There will
   likely be some warnings during compilation, but these don't affect
   the way the program executes.  By capturing the output during the
   make process, we might be able to help you resolve any errors that
   have occurred.

	   make >& make.out & 

   Check the makefile for the name of the output executable.  It should
   be a.out, sprint.e, or sprint_tst.e depending on the platform.  Some 
   machines such as DEC don't allow the default a.out to be renamed to 
   something similar to source file names.  The SUN and ALPHA platforms
   are where we do most of our testing so that those outputs are named
   sprint_tst.e to prevent overwriting sprint.e, the production version.
   
   Newer DEC/Alpha machines may give you an error ("Text file busy")
   during the link phase if the file named on the COMMAND line is being 
   executed while you are trying to rebuild the executable.  If this 
   happens, delete the executing sprint_tst.e process and re-execute 
   make.
