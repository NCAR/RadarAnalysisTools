   CEDERX.f - Changed format statement #675 to write out actual error message.   

   CEDRIC.f - Added LATLON in HEMISPHERE common block to pass it to WINSET.

   COINTRP.f - Made LLE --> LLZ (ICORD = 3) be a path separate from XYE --> XY
              (ICORD = 2) so that coordinate axes were set correctly.  Added
              XGRD and YGRD scratch arrays so that LL-->XY conversions are done
              only for the first vertical level. This speeded up interpolation 
              dramatically.

   CRINTRP.f - Cleaned up comments about various interpolation paths.

   CUTILS.c - Added code to have *_coord_sys = 'XYZ' for either CRT or XYZ and
              *_coord_sys = XYE for either ELE or XYE.  The following ICORD
              values were added: ICORD=3 for LLE --> LLZ and ICORD=7 for LLZ
              --> XYZ.  XYE --> LLZ is still not allowed.

   FUNCTS.f - Added comment lines for each function to make it easier to follow
              the paths rather than always referring back to FUNCTN.  Also,
              deleted all code that changed the sign on longitude since that is
	      now done inside LL2XYDRV and XY2LLDRV.

   LLINTRP.f - Added XGRD and YGRD scratch arrays so that LL-->XY conversions
	      are done only for the first vertical level. This speeded up the
	      interpolation quite a bit.  I also got rid of some variables that
              were never accessed.

   PLTDRV.f - Added trap to prevent PLTSTA from being called when doing non-XY
              plots.  This was causing VALLEV(L) to be accessed with 
              L > MAXZLEV.

   READVL.f - Fixed code to set LATLON always.  Was only doing so for Lon-lat
              so if an XY coordinate system was read in after a LL one then
              LATLON was still TRUE.

   REMAP.f -  Added paths for ICORD=3 and 7.  Also some parts were incomplete
              tests such as not testing on ICORD=5.

   STATS.f -  Changed DATA LAX from XYZ to LLZ, but don't remember why.
	     
   TRPCO.f -  Added ICORD=3 path. 

   WINSET.f - Added HEMISPHERE common block to get LATLON to set plot WINDOW to
              nice integer numbers for lon-lat grids.  Need to have WINDOW in
              job stack for this to happen.

1999/0519: Embarking on major changes to REMAP path to speed it up.  Right now it
         is taking about 20 min per volume which is too excessive.

   COINTRP.f - Moved all the LL --> XY grid calculations into TRPCO so that
               this done only once as the interpolation passes through the
               grid.  Compare COINTRP.f-old and TRPCO.f-old with new versions,
               COINTRP and TRPCO.  This also meant that several more variables
               need to be passed to TRPCO.  Right now all others calls to TRPCO
               have not been fixed.  No other interpolations will actually
               work.

   TRPCO.f -   Moved LL --> XY grid calculations here from COINTRP.  This has
               helped speed up the interpolation from LLE --> LLZ by a lot, but
               still takes a long time, perhaps hours down to tens of minutes.

   VALNYQ  -   Added variable in FETCHZ in order to pass Nyquist velocities
               from the level header to accomodate different Nyquists from
               NEXRADs.  This affected CEDCDF, CREATE, FETCHD, FUNCTS, LLINTRP,
               NEW_CEDCDF, NEW_WRITVL, PLTDRV, REMAP, WINDIJ, and WRITVL.


1999/0804: Fixed problem with reading netCDF files

   CEDCDF.f - Changed ICDFID(IFILE) = NCOPN(LOUTNM,NCWRITE,RCODE)
                   to ICDFID(IFILE) = NCOPN(LOUTNM,NCREAD,RCODE)
              in order to open Gridder output files that are read-only.  
              Note: NCOPN is from the old version of netCDF utilities and the
              variable NCWRITE is interpreted as a character string.
              
1999/0817: Fixed problem with calculation of ZCART.  The curved Earth correction
         using AKZI was non-zero only if XYDIST, RANGE, AZ, or EL was done
         before the ZCART function.

   FUNCTS.f - Moved AKZI calculation to the top of the routine so it will
              always be calculated regardless of the order of FUNCTIONS.

1999/0818: Hildebrand's cedric problem is a non-problem.  SUNs give a floating
         point underflow warning when doing ISOSURFACES, but it is not fatal.
         DEC/Alpha cedar gives no warning at all.

   DSP3D.f - Increased sizes for axes' labels from 0 --> 3 in CALL PWRZI, 
                                               |
	     e.g. CALL PWRZI(RXL, YD, ZD,'X',1,0,1,3,1)
	          CALL PWRZI(RXL, YD, ZD,'X',1,3,1,3,1)

1999/0902: Added the capability of plotting either the Slope = 1 or -1
         1:1 line on scatter plots.
   
   PLTDRV.f - minor changes to setup ISLOPE array for specifying the slope 
         for each scatter plot (Note: if the user inputs -1, then a negative
         slope is plotted, but the ABS value is used for determining the
         correlation fit.

   SCTDSP.f - borrowed code from the PPI program to draw simple curves on
         scatter plots.  For this case, used the 1:1 line with +/- 1 slope.
         

1999/0915: Replaced "STOP" with "CALL FLUSH_STDOUT" to flush all of stdout 
         (Unit 6) cache to help ensure that CEDRIC generated output is
         completely captured.  This affected the following routines:

	 CEDCDF, CEDERX, COINTRP, CRINTRP, DSP3D, FETCHD, FETCHZ, GRIDAIR,
	 INTGRT, LAPDRV, LL2XYDRV, LLINTRP, NEW_CEDCDF, NEW_WRITVL, OUTPCK,
	 PATCHR, PLTACT, REMAP, ROVECT, SCTDSP, SETCOL, SETDCD, SETER, SETVOL,
	 SHIFTIT, SKIPP, STPDRV, SYNNER, TRPCO, VECDRW, VECDSP, WRITVL,
	 XY2LLDRV

1999/0929: Added special pnemonics in FIXIDS to replace the Oye gridder output
         (x,y) coordinates for the WSR-88D radar to be the lon-lat of the
         radar.  For example, 

	          FIXIDS  RAD(X)          RAD(Y)

         will cause FIXIDS to transfer the longitude and latitude of the
         origin, ID words 36-38 and ID words 33-35, into words 315 and 316.
         This was done so that the SYNTHES command would have "correct" radar
	 locations.

1999/0929: Added maximum value and its location to print out.  The labels 
         on plots (max+) are tied to the field contour label so there isn't 
         enough room for plotting max and its location when doing overlays.

   PLOTCH.f - Write out format 53 and made a note at the top about the array
         CSP.  I got tired of trying to remember which index is for axis and
         which is for min-max-spacing.  The second index is for the axis.

C     Note:
C        CSP(1,1), CSP(2,1), CSP(3,1) = XMIN, XMAX, XDEL
C        CSP(1,2), CSP(2,2), CSP(3,2) = YMIN, YMAX, YDEL
C        CSP(1,3), CSP(2,3), CSP(3,3) = ZMIN, ZMAX, ZDEL

2000/0203: Increased number of values written from ITEM --> ILHD from
         6 to 7 so that all 10 values of level header get transfered into
         ILHD.  Nyquist was zero because only 9 values were transfered.
         Problem was CALL ALTER in routine PLANST.

2000/0302: Increased NX x NY to 511 x 511 in CEDRIC.INC to accomodate
         increases done in Sprint.
2000/0303: Added input of VNYQ to BLHED --> level header #10.   Changes
         also made in WRITVL to pass VALNYQ into BLHED.
2000/0324: removed NID in call to FETCHD inside DSPCOD.  This was causing
         IFIXAX to be 0 so display SURFACES other than IFIXAX=3 failed.
2000/1121: added code to PLANST to set the level header Nyquist velocity
         when it is zero (REORDER).  I also fixed BLHED to move level
         header information into the output Cedric volume.  I added the
         volume Nyquist (VNYQ_VOL) to the LEVELS common block for future
         usage.
2000/1128: reconstructed REMAP, CRINTRP, COINTRP, LLINTRP, and TRPCO to
         have weights (WXYC) and indices (IXYC) computed in the routines
         that call TRPCO rather than in TRPCO.  I had moved some code out
         of COINTRP into TRPCO, but this messed up CRINTRP.  See TRPCO.f
         in ~/Cedric-new/trpco.  I restored the FETCHDs in TRPCO rather than
         storing values in FLD(MAXX,MAXY,MAXZLEV) until I determine if it 
         might be best to increase the memory with a big array for field
         values.  See ~/Cedric-new/trpco for versions of TRPCO routines,
         with (without) FLD.
2001/0509: Merged my version with Sherrie's by copying all modules from
         /ash/sherrie/Cedric (into ~/Cedric-new/Sherrie) that had been 
         modified from those in my directory (~/Cedric-new).  Moved my
         versions into ~/Cedric-new/Mine.  I went through all modules in 
         common between ~/Cedric-new/Mine and ~/Cedric-new/Sherrie and
         copied Sherrie's modified ones into ~/Cedric-new.  I moved all
         new modules not in ./Mine, but in ./Sherrie into ~/Cedric-new.  
         I also copied all of /ash/sherrie/Cedric/include into ~Cedric-new
         since these *.h ... files are needed in the mdv stuff.  Only
         cedric.h will need to fixed for other platforms since what is
         in ~/Cedric-new is for Sun/Solaris.  I copied modifications file
         from ./Mine since Sherrie's version was older.  
2001/0521: Changed REMAP parameter MAXMEMORY to allow for MAXX/2 and MAXY/2
         with MXCRT = 35 (changed from 12).  This will let Cedric accomodate
         the larger dimensions of 255 by 255 by 35 levels now in Sprint.
         Changed CUTILS.c to trap SUR scan from REORDER.
2001/0531: Changed CEDRIC, PLTDRV, PLOTCH, PLTACT, READAIR, and genmap
         to allow the user to increase line width for aircraft and map
         overlays.  This is done through the READAIR command (P9) and
         pertains to internal variables AIRTHK and THKMAP.  I also bumped
         the default line thickness from 1000 to 1200.
2001/0608: Fixed the second CALL FETCHD right after "IF(LVTON) THEN."  There
         was an extra comma in the parameter list.

         CALL FETCHD(IEDFL,ID,,L,IDBZ,IBUF,RBUF(1,5),NIX,NIY,3,BAD,RLEV,NST)

2001/0612: Fixed minor problem in PLTDRV and PLOTCH where the variables from 
         the GRAPHICS command were being printed before they were assigned.  
         This was only a wild guess as to what was causing Justin Cox's
         (Univ. of Utah) problem with cedric.  Regardless, it was a needed
         fix since the printing of the Maximum values for each level, each
         field were ugly and the first level variables were not assigned.

2001/0803: Changed some formats to output integers with leading zeroes so
         that dates and such don't have blanks in them (e.g., I2.2).  There
         were several places where these minor changes were made, but it is
         unlikely that all have been found.

2001/0918: Changed code in SYNDRV, DSPSYN, CEDERX, SYNNER, and IDSYND to
         allow as many as MAXTRF=8 (MXFS=10) fields to be transferred during
         execution of the SYNTHES command.   Originally only 5 could be
         transferred, but SYNDRV never issued a fatal error and went on as
         if everything was okay.  That has all been fixed.

2002/Mar-Apr: Added or modified code to include doing VAD analysis with
	 gridded data.  This includes new commands VAD and PLTVAD for
	 specifying the parameters for this type of analysis by doing either
         a Fourier (FOUR) or least-squares (LSQR) fit to radial velocities.
	 The routines involved are PLTVAD.f-new, SAVVAD.f-new, VAD.f-new,
         VADCORD.f-new, and VADDRV.f-new.

2002/0603-0605: Added or modified code to include MGLASS soundings.
	 makefiles.list-new: added routines modified from those in Ppi_mmm
	 GETSND.f:    routine to read MGLASS sounding and plot SkewT
	 SOUND.f:     routine to extract user-requested sounding field (left out
		      RADVEL since easier to use SAMPLER command)
         THERMO.f:    all thermodynamic FUNCTIONs (ESAT, OD, OS, ...)
	 PPI_IFIND.f: IFIND from ppi, renamed since there is already an IFIND
         snding.inc:  common block /SNDING/ for MGLASS sounding variables
         FUNCTN.f-new: modified to include new function SOUND
         FUNCTS.f-new: modified to include new CALL SOUND, where the actual
		       code to extract thermodynamic variables is located
         CEDRIC.f-new: modified to include GETSND command
         UNFOLD.f:     fixed specification of VNYQ for UNFOLDing so that if
		       the user specifies this parameter, then the program
		       will override both the volume and level header values
         MYFRAME.f:    moved the FRAME time/date stamp up a little
         link.new:     links to *-new to preserve older versions that Sherrie
		       is still linked to for modifications that she is doing.
         SYNDRV.f:     added a NOTE about WEIGHT array that I had thought was
		       accessible to the user.  It turns out that CEDRIC sets
		       the WEIGHTs internally to 1 via character IENDC1.
         CIN.c:        found and commented out printf that was outputting the
		       510-word header when SYNTHES command is executed.

2002/0906-0913: Merged Sherrie Fredrick's WRF netCDF ingest and analysis
         routines (WRFCDF.f and wrf_nc.c) into the latest version of Cedric
	 (release date September 13, 2002).  This merging involved CEDRIC,
	 FETCHZ, READVL, and SETVOL since all of these routines involve some
         aspect of ingesting a disk file into CEDRIC's internal edit file.
         Along the way, I changed the common block /NETCDF/ to /CDFNET/ to
         avoid any conflicts with any /NETCDF/ common block in the netCDF
         libraries.  Duplicated CONFLD with CONFLDR so that CONFLD could be
	 called more than once in a routine on Linux without compilation 
	 warning about mismatch of parameter types (e.g., PLTDRV and STATS).
