      SUBROUTINE SBYTES (NPACK,ISAM,IBIT,NBITS,NSKIP,ITER)
C
C     This subroutine packs bits from the input array ISAM to the
C     output array NPACK.  After skipping "IBIT" bits in NPACK,
C     the "NBITS" rightmost bits from "ITER" successive words
C     in "ISAM" are packed into "NPACK" with "NSKIP" bits between each
C     moved block.
C
C
C     NPACK
C       Address of the first word of the array to be packed.
C
C     ISAM
C       Array to be packed into NPACK.  The right-most NBITS
C       bits of each word will be packed.  ISAM should be
C       dimensioned for at least ITER.
C
C     IBIT
C       A bit-count offset to be used before the first bits are
C       packed into NPACK.  For example, if IBIT=3 and NBITS=5,
C       3 bits in NPACK will be skipped before the right-most
C       5 bits of ISAM(1) are packed into it.
C
C     NBITS
C       The number of bits in each word of ISAM to be unpacked.
C       NBITS must not exceed the word size on the given machine.
C
C     NSKIP
C       The number of bits to skip in NPACK between packing each
C       bit chunk from ISAM.
C
C     ITER
C       The number of bit chunks to be packed.
C
C
C Example:
C
C     CALL SBYTES(NPC,ISB,45,6,3,2)
C
C In this call, 45 bits would be skipped at the beginning of NPC;
C the right-most 6 bits of ISB(1) would be packed into NPC; 3 bits
C would be skipped in NPC; the right-most 6 bits of ISB(2) would
C be packed into NPC.
