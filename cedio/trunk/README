                     CEDRIC Input/Output modules

This package contains modules for building a user-specific software package to
perform one of the following:

cedread - Read an existing CEDRIC binary format data file.  Useful for reading
	CEDRIC data into internal arrays for interfacing with other programs,
	manipulating data in some way not available within CEDRIC, or some
	other similar operation.  The user determines what to do with the data.
	No CEDRIC format data files are written.

cedwrite - Write a new CEDRIC binary format data file.  Useful for interfacing
	with your own programs and then writing out files in CEDRIC format for
	further manipulation with CEDRIC.

cedrdwrt - Read an existing CEDRIC format file, do some manipulations not
	available in CEDRIC, and then write your new results out in CEDRIC
	format.

See cedread.doc and cedwrite.doc for more details and appendix.ps for a
description of the CEDRIC data format.

Building this NCAR/MMM CEDRIC I/O package on your machine:

	1. Modify the links in set.links file for the particular platform.

	2. Create a subdirectory for compilation (e.g., Compile as done here).

	3. Go to that subdirectory (cd Compile).

	4. Set a link back to the set.links file.

		ln -s ../set.links .

	5. Source the set.links file for links back to the source files, etc.

		source set.links

	6. Make the objects and link with libraries for executable by typing:

		make cedread  >& make-cedread.out &
	   or
		make cedwrite >& make-cedwrite.out &
           or
		make cedrdwrt >& make-cedrdwrt.out &

	7. Step 6 produces executable files cedread, cedwrite, or cedrdwrt.

	8. Create a subdirectory for execution (e.g. , Run-tests as done here).

	9. Go to that subdirectory (cd Run-tests) and link back to executables
	   in the compilation subdirectory.  An example CEDRIC data file is
	   Run-tests/spr_950805.1325-1335.dat and a simple script for running
	   CEDRIC is ced_qwik.dec (example was executed on an MMM DEC/Alpha).

		ln -s ../Compile/cedread .
		ln -s ../Compile/cedwrite .
		ln -s ../Compile/cedrdwrt .

	10. Run the appropriate program.  cedread and cedrdwrt require a CEDRIC
	    data input file linked to fortran unit 10. 

		ln -s spr_950805.1325-1335.dat fort.10
	   then
		cedread >& cedread.out &
	    or
		cedrdwrt >& cedrdwrt.out &
	    
	    No input unit needed.  Data output is written to fortran unit 20.
		cedwrite >& cedwrite.out &
