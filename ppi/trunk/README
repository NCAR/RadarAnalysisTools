RADAR DATA FILES - A note on byte ordering and computer word size:  

There are two important considerations when reading radar data disk files: 
(1) the number of bits or computer word size used to represent integer values, 
and (2) the way bytes are numbered (little or big Endian) within these integers.

   (1) Most workstations and Linux PCs use 32-bit integers, while others such 
as CRAYs use 64 bits.  However, some vendors refer to their machines as 64-bit 
machines when in fact they represent integers with 32 bits, but use 64-bit 
memory addressing.  Typically the original radar-measured data values are 
represented as scaled integers with lengths of 8-16 bits.  Most programs read 
a beams worth of these integer values into an internal integer array which must
be unpacked and the values scaled before putting them into floating-point
arrays for later display and algebraic manipulation.  Therefore, in order to 
correctly unpack the integer arrays holding the data values, both the original 
data word size and computer word size for the particular platform where the 
program is executing must be known.  

(Post April 9, 2012):  More recently, 64-bit PCs have become available and will 
likely become more the norm for the near future.

   (2) If a radar input data file is written and read on the same type of 
machine, then no byte-swapping is required.  However, if the file was written
on one type of machine and is being read on another type, then byte-swapping
will be required.  There are two byte-numbering schemes: "little Endian"
(e.g. DEC, where the last byte is the most significant one or bytes of a 32-bit
integer word are numbered 4-3-2-1) and "big Endian" (e.g. SUN, where the
first byte is the most significant one or the bytes of a 32-bit integer word
are numbered 1-2-3-4).  Here we will refer to these by the easier-to-remember
names of DEC-like or SUN-like byte-numbering.  PCs use the same byte numbering
convention as DEC, while most other machines use the same one as SUN.  The
default assumption is that radar data written on a SUN-like machine is
being read on a SUN-like machine, i.e. byte-swapping is not required.  The
exception to this is COS-blocked radar data (Universal or ATD/Field format)
from the NCAR Mass Store System which must always be byte-swapped when being
read on a DEC-like machine.

PPI_MMM SOFTWARE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Makefiles are provided for DEC/Alpha, Cray/YMP and J90s, DEC/Ultrix, HP, 
Linux (gnu compiler/linker), SGI, Sun/Solaris, and Sun/OS.  This software has 
been installed on DEC, Sun, SGI, and Linux platforms in NCAR/MMM.  All except
Linux are served /usr/local, /usr/common, and user files provided by a common 
file server.  Libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib.

(April 9, 2010): The PPI_MMM program build procedure has been modified to now
have only 32- and 64-bit versions.  Older files for Linux variants are still
in the distribution, but the installation has been simplified to only 32-
and 64-bit versions without regard to individual vendor Linux variants.
The build process now involves only
	a. Execute set.links-32 or set.links-64 which links the 32- and 64-bit
           versions of wordsize-specific files. These files include cedric.h-x,
	   dorade.h-x, makefile-x, op_sys.h-x, and WORD.size-x.  The "-x"
	   stands for either -32 or -64 versions.
	b. Once the word-size dependent files are linked to their counter-
 	   parts without the "-x", execute make.
These word-size-specific files all have BYTE_ORDER set to 1 (Little Endian).
Change BYTE_ORDER to 0 (Big Endian) if necessary.          

(Post April 9, 2012):  The build procedure has been modified so that there
is no longer a distinction between 32- and 64-bit machines.  In the NCAR/EOL
computing environment, the servers (tikal and barolo) are DELL desktop work
stations.  As such they are 64-bit architectures, with 32-bit integers.  The
ppi software no longer requires changes to word size, i.e. cedric.h, dorade.h,
op_sys.h, WORD.size, and gtDefines.h all of which have WORDSIZE set to 32.

(Post April 9, 2012):  The makefiles in the distribution now refer only to 
machines within the EOL computing environment (e.g. makefile-bora was used 
for an older 32-bit machine which no longer exists and makefile-tikal is now 
being used for building the ppi program on a 64-bit architecture).

To build the ppi program (ppi_tikal.e) in the NCAR/EOL computing environment: 

make -f makefile-tikal

The program requires that you have NCAR/Graphics installed in your computing 
environment.  You must obtain that package from NCAR/SCD if you do not already
have it installed.  See the NCAR/SCD website 

        http://ngwww.ucar.edu

for ordering and other information pertinent to getting and using NCAR
Graphics.

Once the tar file has been obtained from our ftp server, we recommend untaring
the source code in a secure directory and creating another directory elsewhere
suitable for building the object and executable files.  About 100-200Mbytes of
disk space is needed for compiling and linking.  The final executable will
occupy about 40-90Mbytes of disk space, depending on the dimensions set for an
internal large array (see dim_ppi.inc or dim_rhi.inc).

(Post April 9, 2012):  The software can now be checked out from the UCAR 
subversion archive with the following command:

svn checkout https://proxy.subversion.ucar.edu/RadAnl_Tools/ppi 

which will produce ./ppi in the directory where this command has been 
executed.  The subversion commercial software must be installed on your
local machine

	                      examples of many of the functional capabilities
	                      within the program, and was used for analysis of
	                      RHI data from CP2 during the Small Cumulus Micro-

There are three files that are needed when processing the National Weather
Service (NWS) WSR88D (NEXRAD) radars.  These nexrad_*.txt files were provided
courtesy of Dick Oye NCAR/ATD/RDP.

	nexrad_VCPs.txt        - Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) information.

(Before April 9, 2012):  
 
Once in the directory where the executable is to be built, link files back
to the source directory.  This can be done by sourcing the appropriate script
file for linking:

      source set-links.*  - Script for setting links to files for building the
                            binary and executable files, where (*) refers to
		            the following platforms (* = alpha, cray, dec, hp, 
                            linux, sgi, solaris, or sun_os)

This script will set links for both machine-independent and machine-dependent
modules and scripts.  Machine-dependent files are:

	1) DISP.f    - either DISP_sh.f (CRAYs), DISP_wk.f (UNIX workstations),
                       or DISP_dum.f (dummy routine if DISP.f is not wanted)
	2) MYFRAME.f - either MYFRAME_sh.f (CRAYs) or MYFRAME_wk.f (UNIX
                       workstations)
	3) WORD.size - either WORD.size.32-dec (DEC-like), WORD.size.32-sun
                       (Sun-like), or WORD.size.64 (64 bit Sun-like machines)
	4) makefile  - makefile.*, where (*) is platform name      

Once set-links.* is sourced for the specific platform, execute make in back-
ground with redirection of its output (stdout) and system errors (stderr):

        make >& make.out &  - for compiling and linking.  stdout and stderr are
	                      redirected into make.out to record compiling and
	                      linking errors.  This will help us identify any
			      local installation problems you may have had.
        make >>& make.out & - Restart the make procedure, with redirection
	                      after a problem is fixed.		 

Once you have an executable (a.out or ppi.tst), you can run the test script 
cp2_950710.dec (after some minor modifications to fit your computing environ-
ment) by typing

	(source cp2_950710.dec) >& ppi.out &

or, after creating a ppi.inp file and setting various links following examples
in cp2_950710.dec, type

	ppi.tst < ppi.inp >& ppi.out &

Both variants redirect stdout and stderr into ppi.out and place execution in
the background.  The program will create a "gmeta" file containing the graphical
output as well as the "ppi.out" text output generated by PPI_MMM, both of which
are viewable during program execution.  Use idt, ictrans, or ctrans for the
gmeta file, and the UNIX more or an editor for viewing the ppi.out text file.

When you are building the binary and executable files, we ask that you capture 
the "make" output (stdout) and any system errors (stderr) so that we can more
effectively help you fix any problems.  Also, when you first begin to run the
the PPI_MMM program, we ask that you capture the text output file.  It is not
very helpful to us to hear: "I'm having problems with the ppi program."   We
can be assist you in uncovering the cause of problems when we have a better
idea as to what the problem really is.
