PPI_MMM Release date June 25, 2012

1. Added modules for 32- and 64-bit versions where the word size
   can be set.  These files are all designated as *-32 or *-64.
   a. Invoke these by executing either set.links-32 or set.links-64.
   b. Makefiles (makefile-32 and makefile-64) were fixed to point to
   library locations for 32-bit building on bora and 64-bit building
   on shiraz.
2. Other minor cleanup was done for some modules.
3. Increased the dimension (MXF_DOR=50) for processing Dorade sweep 
   files from DYNAMO.
4. Eliminated all older version directories and files such as those 
   originally written for older machines within CISL (e.g., shavano).
   All files that used syntax for older CISL machines within the NCAR
   graphics have been eliminated.  PPI_mmm now only works on  Linux 
   workstations.
