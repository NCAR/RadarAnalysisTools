PPI_MMM Release date January 12, 2015

1. Added capabilities to output results from Fourier (F) and Least-squares analyses 
   (I) for VAD winds (VADOUT-nn) as well as VAD variances and covariances (COVFOUT-nn
   and/or COVIOUT-nn).  The variance-covariance results come from an analysis of the
   fluctuations from the VAD winds [Vrad(r,a,e)-Vvad(r,a,e)]^2 as described in the
   paper "Single Doppler Radar Measurements of Turbulence Profiles in the Convective
   Boundary Layer", Kropfli (JTech, 1986).
   a. For each input ppi scan, VADOUT-nn is created in VAD.f for both Fourier and
      Least-squares analyses.  Both (F) and (I) analysis approaches are combined in
      the VAD.f module.
   b. For each input ppi scan, COVFOUT-nn is created if using Fourier series analysis
      (CALL VADCOVF.f).
   c. For each input ppi scan, COVIOUT-nn is created if using Least-squares analysis
      (CALL VADCOVF.f).
2. Most other fixes or modifications were minor except for FUNC.f and PRNTFLD.f which 
   were more extensive.

PPI_MMM Release date December 31, 2014

1. Changed dim.inc dimensions for current radar dataset sizes (more gates, more
   sweep angles, and more fields).  There is likely no longer a need to distinguish
   between various formats (e.g., NEXRAD Level II, Dorade, and Universal format). 
      PARAMETER (MXG_NEX=2500,MXF_NEX=10)
      PARAMETER (MXG_DOR=2500,MXF_DOR=100)
      PARAMETER (MXA=800,MXR=2500,MXF=100)

PPI_MMM Release date December 11, 2012

1. General fixes that mostly pertain to debugging prints: CONFILL1,CONLEV,RDUF,
   FLDIDUF,PLTHZ,UFREC,PLTAE,FUNC,LABEL,PPI_MMM,DOREC,RDDOVERDATE.
   a. dorade.h-32 and dorade.h-64: Changed (MXFLD,MXGAT) from (50,1040) to (35,2000)
   b. set.links-32 and set.links-64: Added removal of 32- and 64-specific files
      before setting links to IWORDSZ-specific files
   c. dim.inc - Changed maximum ranges and fields to accomodate new DORADE sweep
      files with many more variables and range gates.
   d. CONFILL1,CONLEV,RDUF,FLDIDUF,PLTHZ,UFREC,PLTAE,FUNC: Mostly addding debug
      prints.
   e. DOREC and RDDO - Added some debugging prints and forced setting of GATSPAC
      and NRNG from DORADE sweepfiles generated by RadxConvert.  Is this a 
      problem with DOREC or is it with RadxConvert?
   f. VERDATE - Changed version date to December 11, 2012 from June 25, 2012.
   g. PPI_MMM - Added some SAVEs, comments, and debugging prints.  Increased 
      NBMAX (number of beams in a volume scan).
   h. LABEL - redefined IDR from km to meters.
2. Fixes to VAD-related routines to allow multiple sweeps within a single
   execution: SAVVAD,PLTVAD,VAD,VADFLD.
   a. SAVVAD - Clarified comment list of local field variable names.
   b. PLTVAD - Changed plotting from DIR to DBZ and ERR to WVD.
   c. VAD - Fixed opening (OPEN) and closing (CLOSE) new file names for each
      sweep VAD analysis so that multiple sweeps can be processed in a single 
      execution over many sweeps.  Added the computation of vertical air motion
      (WVD) from the CON field.  Fixed test that was preventing looping over
      the integration and gate-filling for missing VAD rings.
   d. VADFLD - Cleaned up comment list of local field variable names.  Fixed
      the opening (OPEN) command of sweep-related VAD analyses, consistent with 
      the VAD analysis in VAD.f, so that multiple sweeps can be processed in
      a single run.
3. ppi_32.e runs: ppi_32.e < ppi-spol.inp >& ppi-spol.out-strat_E=all & 
   a. Accessed RadxConvert cfradial --> dorade sweep files from SPOLKa in DYNAMO.
   b. Testing usage and debugging VAD stuff (PLTVAD for VAD or COV
      analyses), along with writing separate "fort.99" files (named VADOUT-nn,
      where nn is the sweep number).  These unique files are written in VAD and
      and read in VADFLD routine.  The PLTVAD inputs from the variables stored
      in the VADWINDS common block (vadwinds.inc).  That common block is set
      aside for a single-sweep analysis.  The VAD radial velocity field is read
      in during a single-sweep execution so it needs to be saved with a unique
      name.  This also facilitates reading these VAD-related fields for plotting
      independent of the PPI_MMM program.

PPI_MMM Release date June 25, 2012

1. Added modules for 32- and 64-bit versions where the word size
   can be set.  These files are all designated as *-32 or *-64.
   a. Invoke these by executing either set.links-32 or set.links-64.
   b. Makefiles (makefile-32 and makefile-64) were fixed to point to
   library locations for 32-bit building on bora and 64-bit building
   on shiraz.
2. Other minor cleanup was done for some modules.
3. Increased the dimension (MXF_DOR=50) for processing Dorade sweep 
   files from DYNAMO.
4. Eliminated all older version directories and files such as those 
   originally written for older machines within CISL (e.g., shavano).
   All files that used syntax for older CISL machines within the NCAR
   graphics have been eliminated.  PPI_mmm now only works on  Linux 
   workstations.
5. Commented out "CALL ASDPMD" in RDUF.f until I figure out reading
   UF files.  This CALL was causing field names to be byte-swapped
   again when changing to another fortran unit.
