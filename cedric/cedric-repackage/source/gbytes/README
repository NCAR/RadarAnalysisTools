These source files were borrowed from the source to the NCAR Graphics C
library (libncarg_c).  Various versions of the gbytes/sbytes routines
are available from the CISL Research Data Archive:

In theory, the packing and unpacking of bits to and from FORTRAN integers
is dependent upon the default size of the INTEGER type in the FORTRAN
compiler, which is *not* dependent upon the architecture word size.
Looking at the yMakefile in the NCAR graphics source, only the CRAY
compiler uses the logic64.c alternative source.  All other architectures,
especially both 32- and 64-bit Linux systems, use the logic32.c module.
Only logic32.c is included here, so these gbytes/sbytes routines are not as
portable as the ones provided with NCAR graphics.
