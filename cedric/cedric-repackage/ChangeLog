	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, source/Makefile.in,
	  source/config.h.in, tests/Makefile.in: Using AC_PROG_FC without
	  AC_PROG_F77 causes a warning from autoconf about "preprocessed
	  Fortran 77 seen but F77 macro not included". However, using just
	  AC_PROG_F77 without AC_PROG_FC causes the Fortran tests for NCAR
	  graphics to fail for AC_LANG([Fortran]). Thus AC_LANG([Fortran
	  77]) is significant because it causes the Fortran link tests to
	  use the F77 variable defined by AC_PROG_F77 and not FC. This
	  removes references to FC and FCFLAGS in all the
	  autoconf-generated files also, and it fixes the automatic search
	  for the directory from which to link NCAR Graphics.

	* configure.ac: try to fix searches for the NCAR Graphics
	  libraries: the successive tests will not run unless the config
	  variable is reset, but apparently that still is not enough

2013-04-01 19:09  granger

	* tests: ignore output files generated by test scripts

2013-04-01 19:07  granger

	* tests, tests/Makefile.in: add the generated Makefile.in so source
	  tree can be configured and built without needing to bootstrap

2013-04-01 19:02  granger

	* examples/ced_examp/ced_examp-cedric.out,
	  examples/ced_examp/ced_examp.out,
	  examples/ced_examp/run_ced_examp,
	  examples/ced_examp/test_ced_examp, testdata/spol,
	  testdata/spol/cedric-baseline.out,
	  testdata/spol/test_spol_header.sh, tests/Makefile.am,
	  tests/diff_cedric, tests/test_ced_examp_cedric,
	  tests/test_ced_examp_gcedric, tests/test_spol_header: add
	  separate test driver scripts which automake calls to collect test
	  results; support output diffs for both cedric and gcedric, but
	  only run gcedric tests when MAKE_WITH_NCARG is enabled; move the
	  diff command for comparing cedric output into a separate
	  diff_cedric script, and allow additional command-line options to
	  quiet the output

2013-03-22 04:20  granger

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, tests,
	  tests/Makefile.am: start adding automated test scripts to
	  automake

2013-03-21 14:49  granger

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config/depcomp, config/install-sh,
	  config/missing, configure, source/Makefile.in: Commit the
	  autoreconf-generated files, including the configure script and
	  helper scripts, so the source tree can be built upon checkout
	  without running autoreconf. If these files ever change after
	  being regenerated (ie, after running config/bootstrap), then they
	  will have to be committed to the repository.

2013-03-21 14:42  granger

	* config/bootstrap: use autoreconf instead of explicit calls to all
	  the tools, but set AUTOMAKE invocation to include --foreign
	  option

2013-03-21 06:51  granger

	* configure.ac, source/Makefile.am, source/gcedric: It turns out a
	  separate subdirectory to build graphical cedric is not needed, so
	  remove it. Instead use per-target flags which cause automake to
	  generate object targets with different names. Create NCARGINCS
	  configure variable alongside NCARGLIBS, and substitute them into
	  Makefiles. Now both cedric and gcedric built in the same source
	  directory, but gcedric only if ncarg is enabled and found.

2013-03-21 05:59  granger

	* source/Makefile.am, source/Makefile.sources, source/gcedric,
	  source/gcedric/Makefile.am: split out source file lists into a
	  single included file, towards building both non-graphical cedric
	  and graphical cedric (gcedric) in the same tree

2013-03-21 05:57  granger

	* configure.ac: search for ncarg libraries by test linking with
	  fortran, and allow the NCARG top directory to be specified with
	  --with-ncarg; use AC_LANG() to set FORTRAN compiler for NCARG
	  tests, but then switch back to C for header checks or else face
	  an avalanche of error messaage

2013-03-19 20:58  granger

	* configure.ac, source/Makefile.am, source/config.h.in: borrow
	  netcdf checks from soloii configure.ac and start using
	  conditionals and autoconf variables in source/Makefile.am

2013-03-19 03:55  granger

	* configure.ac: Start adding the --with-ncarg configure option.

2013-03-19 03:54  granger

	* config/bootstrap: Copy missing dependencies into place since
	  someday they may need to be committed to the repository or
	  bundled in a tar file.

2013-03-15 19:23  granger

	* source/CEDRIC.INC: use relative INCLUDE instead of hardcoding an
	  absolute path

2013-03-15 19:22  granger

	* source/gbytes/logic32.c: oops, was supposed to use local include
	  to find c.h instead of system include

2013-03-15 19:21  granger

	* testdata/spol/test_spol_header.sh: use --text option to diff lest
	  cedric output be detected as binary

2013-03-15 19:21  granger

	* examples/ced_examp/test_ced_examp: must use --text option lest
	  cedric output be detected as binary

2013-03-15 18:56  granger

	* Rename .f files to .F, since the gfortran version on RHEL 5
	  (4.1.2) does not have the -cpp option to force preprocessing, but
	  by convention .F files are preprocessed by gfortran even for
	  older versions.

2013-03-14 21:46  granger

	* examples, testdata, tests: move non-source directories into the
	  new cedric top level
