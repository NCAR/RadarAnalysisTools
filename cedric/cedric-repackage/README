The CEDRIC software can be configured and compiled using the 'configure'
script, generated with the GNU autoconf tools.  See the file INSTALL for
generic information about running configure.  This file is contains release
notes and specific instructions for building CEDRIC.

CEDRIC can be built as two separate executables, gcedric or cedric.
'gcedric' can generate plots of radar data and analysis products using the
NCAR Graphics package, so NCAR Graphics must be installed when gcedric is
compiled.  The 'cedric' executable is built without any support for
plotting and does not require NCAR Graphics.  Both executables are built
from the same source files, except the source code which requires NCAR
Graphics is not compiled if the preprocessor symbol CEDRIC_USE_NCARG is not
defined to 1.  Both cedric and gcedric can read the same input files and
output the same data files, except only gcedric will output any graphical
plots.  This file contains instructions for building one or both
executables.


Release Notes
=============

-- April 2, 2013

Here is a summary of the changes in the CEDRIC source code for this release:

 All .f files renamed to .F to follow the gfortran convention that .F
 source files need to be processed with the preprocessor.

 All references to NCAR Graphics calls are wrapped in preprocesser
 conditionals based on the definition of CEDRIC_USE_NCARG.

 Implicit conversions from CHARACTER type to INTEGER in DATA statements
 have been replaced with Hollerith constants.  The Hollerith extension is
 supported by gfortran whereas the automatic conversion to INTEGER type is
 not.

 All references to the 32-bit or 64-bit distinction for the value of WORDSZ
 have been removed.  Instead WORDSZ is always 32-bit, which corresponds to
 the native INTEGER size for almost all of the known FORTRAN compilers.


Requirements
============

-- Linux FORTRAN --

Currently CEDRIC is only developed on Linux with GNU Fortran (gfortran).
Note that gfortran is an entirely different compiler from the older g77.
CEDRIC depends upon a 32-bit FORTRAN native integer type, but it compiles
on both 32-bit and 64-bit machine architectures.

-- NetCDF --

Both CEDRIC applications require the NetCDF library, either NetCDF 3 or 4.
The NetCDF output is always the classic NetCDF 3 format.

-- NCAR Graphics (required only for generating plots) --

NCAR Graphics is required to build gcedric, but not for the non-graphical
cedric application.


Building with or without NCAR Graphics
======================================

The configure script provides the option --with-ncarg to specify whether to
compile gcedric and its support for NCAR Graphics.  It can be used like so:

 configure --with-ncarg

 Enable building with NCAR Graphics support.  This is the default.  The
 configure script attempts to locate an installation of NCAR Graphics by
 searching common locations.  It first tries to link with NCAR Graphics in
 the standard system directories, and then looks in common locations like
 /opt/local/ncarg, /usr/local/ncarg, and /opt/local.

 configure --with-ncarg=/opt/local/ncarg-5.2.1

 Enable NCAR Graphics and specify the directory in which NCAR Graphics is
 installed.  The configure script generates the right compiler includes and
 library options to link with NCAR Graphics in that location.  The
 configure script exits with an error if a test link fails.

 configure --with-ncarg=no

 Disable NCAR Graphics.  The configure script does not search for NCAR
 Graphics and the 'gcedric' application will not be compiled.


NetCDF compile settings
=======================

The configure script by default expects the netcdf headers and libraries to
be found by the compiler in the standard system locations.  If the default
settings are not correct, then they can be overridden in the environment or
on the configure command line with these variables:

 NETCDFINCS	   Compiler include path option to find netcdf headers. 
 NETCDFLIBS	   Linker library options for netcdf libraries.
 NETCDFLIBDIR	   The directory to search for the default netcdf libraries.

For example, this command configures the compile to use the standard
netcdf4 libraries and dependencies but adds the given directory to the
library search path:

 configure NETCDFLIBDIR=/opt/local/netcdf/lib NETCDFINCS=-I/opt/local/netcdf/include

This command overrides all the netcdf-related compile settings to build
against a custom netcdf3 installation (the HDF libraries are omitted).

 configure NETCDFLIBS='-L/home/me/netcdf/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf -ludunits2' \
 	   NETCDFINCS='-I/home/me/netcdf/include'


Running Make
============

Once the configure script runs successfully, build the executables by
running 'make' from the top level directory.  The non-graphical 'cedric'
application will be in source/cedric, and if NCAR graphics was enabled,
then gcedric will be in source/gcedric.

If you want to install the executables into the bin directory configured by
the {prefix} option, run 'make install'.


Tests
=====

The full CEDRIC source tree includes some examples which can be used for
testing.  Run 'make check' to run the tests.  The tests run cedric (and
gcedric if enabled) and compare the output with known good output files.
The tests fail if there are any unexpected differences.  Sometimes these
differences are insignificant, such as differences in decimal formatting.
