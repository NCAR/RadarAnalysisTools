C PURPOSE                SRFACE draws a perspective picture of a
C                        function of two variables with hidden lines
C                        removed.  The function is approximated by a
C                        two-dimensional array of heights.
C
C USAGE                  If the following assumptions are met, use
C

C
C                          assumptions:
C                              .the entire array is to be drawn,
C                              .the data are equally spaced (in the
C                               X-Y plane),
C                              .no stereo pairs,
C                              .scaling is chosen internally.
C
C                        If these assumptions are not met use
C
C                             CALL SRFACE (X,Y,Z,M,MX,NX,NY,S,
C                                          STEREO)

C                          above the middle Z, negative below).

C ON INPUT               X
C FOR SRFACE               A linear array NX long containing the X
C                          coordinates of the points in the surface
C                          approximation, in increasing numerical order.
C                          See note, below.

C                          coordinates of the points in the surface
C                          approximation, in increasing numerical order.
C                          See note, below.
C
C                        Z
C                          An array MX by NY containing the surface
C                          to be drawn in NX by NY cells.
C                          Z(I,J) = F(X(I),Y(J)).  See note, below.
C
C                        M
C                          Scratch array at least 2*NX*NY words
C                          long.
C
C                        MX
C                          First dimension of Z.
C
C                        NX
C                          Number of data values in the X direction
C                          (the first subscript direction) in Z.
C                          to be plotted. When plotting an entire
C                          array, MX=NX.
C
C                        NY
C                          Number of data values in the Y direction
C                          (the second subscript direction) to be
C                          plotted.
C
C                        S
C                          S defines the line of sight.  The viewer's
C                          eye is at (S(1), S(2), S(3)) and the
C                          point looked at is at (S(4), S(5), S(6)).
C                          The eye should be outside the block with
C                          opposite corners (X(1), Y(1), ZMIN) and
C                          (X(NX), Y(NY), ZMAX) and the point looked
C                          at should be inside it.  For a nice
C                          perspective effect, the distance between
C                          the eye and the point looked at should be
C                          5 to 10 times the size of the block.  See
C                          note, below.
C
C                        STEREO
C                          Flag to indicate if stereo pairs are to
C                          be drawn.  0.0 means no stereo pair (one
C                          picture).  Non-zero means put out two
C                          pictures.  The value of STEREO is the
C                          relative angle between the eyes.  A value
C                          of 1.0 produces standard separation.
C                          Negative STEREO reverses the left and
C                          right figures.  See the documentation below
C                          for internal variable ISTP for additional
C                          information.
C
C ON OUTPUT              X, Y, Z, MX, NX, NY, S, STEREO are
C FOR SRFACE             unchanged.  M has been written in.
C
C NOTES                  . The range of Z compared with the range
C                          of X and Y determines the shape of the
C                          picture.  They are assumed to be in the
C                          same units and not wildly different in
C                          magnitude.  S is assumed to be in the
C                          same units as X, Y, and Z.
C                        . Picture size can be made relative to
C                          distance.  See comments in SETR.
C                        . TRN32S can be used to translate from 3
C                          space to 2 space.  See comments there.
C                        . Data with extreme discontinuities may
C                          cause visibility errors.  If this problem
C                          occurs, use a distant eye position
C                          away from the +Z axis.
C                        . The default line color is set to
C                          color index 1.  If the user wishes to
C                          change the line color, he can do so by
C                          defining color index 1 before calling
C                          SRFACE, or by putting the common block
C                          SRFINT in his calling program and
C                          defining and using color index ISRFMJ
C                          (defaulted to 1 in BLOCKDATA.)
