      SUBROUTINE GBYTES (NPACK,ISAM,IBIT,NBITS,NSKIP,ITER)
C
C     This subroutine unpacks bit chunks from the input array NPACK
C     into the output array ISAM.  "ITER" bit chunks of length
C     "NBITS" with "NSKIP" bits being skipped between each bit
C     chunk in the input array are unpacked into ISAM.  Each
C     bit chunk in the input array it unpacked into a separate
C     word in ISAM, right-justified with zero-fill.  Initially
C     "IBIT" bits will be skipped at the beginning of the
C     input array before unpacking.
C
C
C     NPACK
C       Address of the first word of the array to be unpacked.
C
C     ISAM
C       Array to receive the unpacked bit chunks.  They will be
C       right-justified with zero-fill in this array.  ISAM
C       should be dimensioned for ITER.
C
C     IBIT
C       A bit-count offset to be used before the first bit chunk is
C       unpacked.  For example, if IBIT=3 and NBITS=5, then
C       3 bits in NPACK will be skipped and the next 5 bits
C       will be unpacked into ISAM(1).
C
C     NBITS
C       The number of bits in each bit chunk to be unpacked.
C
C     NSKIP
C       The number of bits to skip between each bit chunk to be
C       unpacked (after the first bit chunk has been unpacked.)
C
C     ITER
C       The number of bit chunks to be unpacked.
C

C Example:
C
C      CALL GBYTES(NPB,ISB,3,6,9,2)
C
C In this call, 3 bits would be skipped at the beginning of NPB;
C the next 6 bits would be unpacked into ISB(1) right-justified with
C zero-fill; 9 bits would be skipped in NPB; the next six bits of
C NPB would be unpacked into ISB(2) right-justified with zero-fill.

C     Define bit mask to be used for the words in ISAM

C
C     Calculate the bit position in the input array where the bits
C     are to be unpacked.
C
      BPO = IBIT+(I-1)*BITSEP
C
C     Calculate the word position in the input array where the bits
C     are to be unpacked.
