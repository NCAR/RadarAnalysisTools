/*************************************************************************
 * The MDV FILE STRUCTURE looks like:
 *
 *         MDV_master_header
 *         MDV_field_header 1 
 *         MDV_field_header 2
 *           ...
 *         MDV_field_header n
 *         MDV_vlevel_header 1  (optional, if one exists, then all must exist)
 *         MDV_vlevel_header 2
 *           ...
 *         MDV_vlevel_header n
 *         MDV_chunk_header 1   (optional)
 *         MDV_chunk_header 2
 *           ...
 *         MDV_chunk_header n
 *         field 1 data
 *         field 2 data
 *           ...
 *         field n data
 *         chunk 1 
 *           ...
 *         chunk n
 *
 *  The master header is followed by each field header.
 *  Then follow the optional vlevel headers and chunk headers.
 *
 *  Data records for each field follow the headers.
 *  Chunk data is written last.
 * 
 *  All headers and data fields have fortran compatible record length
 *  wrappers, and can be directly read/written using fortran unformatted I/O.
 *
 *  MDV files are stored in big-endian format. On little-endian machines,
 *  the values in the file must be swapped after input and before output.
 *  The MDV library routines handle that for the user, except for chunk
 *  data which is not recognized by the MDV library.
 *
 *  Field data is stored at the offset of the given in the field header.
 *
 *  If the field data is uncompressed, it is stored as a contiguous array,
 *  starting at the lowest plane and working upwards. 
 *  The order of the data in each plane is specified by grid_order_direction
 *  and grid_order_indices in the master header.
 *
 *  If the field data is compressed, there are two 32-bit integer arrays at
 *  the start of the field data buffer, followed by the data itself.
 *
 *  The first array gives the offsets of the compressed data in the buffer,
 *  relative to the first byte after plane_n_len. In other words the offsets
 *  are calculated relative to the end of the offset and length arrays.
 *  The first offset will always be 0.
 *  The second array gives the lengths of the compressed data in the buffer.
 *  
 *        plane_1_offset
 *        plane_2_offset
 *             .
 *             .
 *        plane_n_offset
 *
 *        plane_1_len
 *        plane_2_len
 *             .
 *             .
 *        plane_n_len
 * 
 *        plane_1_compressed_data
 *        plane_2_compressed_data
 *             .
 *             .
 *        plane_n_compressed_data
 *
 *  plane_x_offset gives the offset, in bytes, from the beginning of field
 *  volume buffer. plane_x_len gives the length, in bytes,
 *  of plane_x_encoded_data.
 *
 * Supported compression types are:
 *   MDV_COMPRESSION_NONE - uncompressed
 *   MDV_COMPRESSION_RLE - see <toolsa/compress.h>
 *   MDV_COMPRESSION_LZO - see <toolsa/compress.h>
 *   MDV_COMPRESSION_GZIP - see <toolsa/compress.h>
