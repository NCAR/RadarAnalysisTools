      SUBROUTINE NWTSTR (PX,PY,CH)
C
C *************************************************************
C
C This subroutine is a routine which converts calls to
C GTX to calls to PCHIQU.  Direct calls to GTX produce
C distortions in the characters due to the current
C normalization transformation.  PCHIQU avoids this
C problem by using a uniform transformation.

      CHARACTER*(*) CH
      REAL VP(4),WN(4)
C
C Determine the centering option.

C Determine character height.

	 YPORT  = VP(4) - VP(3)
	SIZE = CHARH * YPORT
C
C Determine character orientation.
