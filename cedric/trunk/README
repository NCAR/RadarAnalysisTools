CEDRIC Release date September 24, 2012 (my_commits-c)

These commits are mostly fixes to some obsolete NCAR Graphics utilities.

1. Changed modules for 32- and 64-bit versions where the word size
   can be set.  These files are all designated as *-32 or *-64.
   a. Invoke these by executing either set.links-32 or set.links-64.
   b. Makefiles (makefile-32 and makefile-64) were fixed to point to
      library locations for 32-bit (64-bit) building on bora (shiraz).
   c. This approach has been tested and everything is almost right.

2. It is not clear to me that the WORDSZ parameter set in CEDRIC.INC
   should be WORDSZ=64 when building on a 64-bit machine.
   a. Historically, CEDRIC grew up in the 1980s on the old CRAY
      XMP and YMP which to the best of my recollection also had
      64-bit integers in Fortran.
   b. Port to 32-bit SUN, DEC, ... workstations included WORDSZ=32
      which has worked for years, even after ports to 32-bit PC-based
      desktops.
   c. Now, with ports to 64-bit PC-based workstations, WORDSZ=64
      leads to a few odd values in fields.  All this is a result
      of using the old SCD gbytes-sbytes Fortran utilities for
      packing-unpacking into Fortran integers.
3. The question arises is whether or not WORDSZ=32, even for a 64-bit
   build, is correct.  This has been tested and works without any
   odd values.
