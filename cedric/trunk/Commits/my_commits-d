CEDRIC Release date April 15, 2013 (my_commits-d)

1. These commits straightened out the issue of WORDSZ = 32 or 64, set
   in CEDRIC.INC and cedric.h modules.  The computer word size as used
   in CEDRIC is the size of any INTEGER variable and is independent
   of the word size of 32- or 64-bit computer architectures.  All known
   Linux compilers have 32-bit native integer sizes.
   a. There is now only one CEDRIC.INC, with WORDSZ=32, and one cedric.h,
      with WORD_SIZE 32.
   b. Separate set.links have been deleted.
   c. In the EOL computing environment, makefile-32 has been renamed
      makefile-bora (32-bit machine) and makefile-64 has been renamed
      makefile-shiraz.
2. CEDRIC is built with "make -f makefile-bora" or "make -f makefile-shiraz"
   to produce 32-bit (bora) or 64-bit (shiraz) versions.  These makefiles
   differ some in where libraries are located.
3. This commit also includes the deletion of older directories that 
   were carry-overs from previous variants of Linux (sgi, hp, alpha, etc.)
4. Some diagnostic prints have been commented out.
5. CEDRIC has been fully tested on Radx2Grid output in the Cedric
   pure binary format.  Radx2Grid is a replacement gridder for both
   SPRINT and REORDER gridding approaches.  The REORDER approach is
   still undergoing refinement.
