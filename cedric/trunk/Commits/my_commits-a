CEDRIC Release date July 24, 2012

These commits are the beginnings associated with building 32- and
64-bit versions.  

Much will likely need fixing as output from the 64-bit version is
compared with output from the 32-bit version.

1. Changed modules for 32- and 64-bit versions where the word size
   can be set.  These files are all designated as *-32 or *-64.
   a. Invoke these by executing either set.links-32 or set.links-64
      after executing rm.links to eliminate older links.
   b. Makefiles (makefile-32 and makefile-64) were fixed to point to
      library locations for 32-bit (64-bit) building on bora (shiraz).
2. Other minor cleanup was done for some modules.
3. Added MAXTRF parameter  for MXFS calculations.
4. Commented out any references to using WRF model output.  Also,
   moved any modules that only pertained to WRF to With_WRF directory
   and deleted these from the makefiles.list since they will no longer
   be needed.
5. Fussing with how best to convert from the obsolete (CPUX,CPUY) NCAR
   graphics conversion routines from Plotter Address Units (1 to 1024)
   to fractional units (CFUX,CFUY).
